Let me ask you to provide me the code of a web page, following my specific requirements, please.
1. I want to have index.html, index.js and styles.css files.
2. Generate valid HTML5 page and link js and css files from the first requirement to it.
3. Background color of the page should be light grey.
4. JS file should be linked to the page after all the html tags are loaded.
5. The page is divided into two horizontal rows: 'main card' row, which takes 2/3 of height and 'buttons' row, which takes other 1/3 of page height.
6. Add a large playing card to the 'main card' row (let's call it 'main card'), the 'main card' should be centered both horizontally and vertically in the row.
7. 'main card' background color is grey, its corners are rounded, it has a slight nice shadow.
8. Let's memorize 'colors options': black or white.
9. Add medium-sized squares with rounded corners of each color from 'colors options' to the 'buttons' row with not big space between those squares.
10. 'buttons' row should have some reasonable top and bottom padding.
11. Upon click on any square from the 'buttons' row, the 'main card' flips 180 degrees via CSS. Background color of back side of the 'main card' is randomly taken from 'colors options', not depending on the color of the button clicked. 
12. After 1 second 'main card' flips back having grey background color.
